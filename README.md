# Areas of Interests for OpenstreetMap

This repository contains the source code of my thesis, which aims to evaluate the use of BigData technologies for Spatial GeoData. As use case, Areas of Interests (AOI) based on OpenstreeMap data are generated.

2) Evaluate applicability of implementation and identify bottlenecks
3) Evaluate suitable BigData technology stack
4) Generate AOI with evaluated BigData framework
5) ...
