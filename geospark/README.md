## Apache Spark Implementation

This is the Apache Spark implementation to generate AOIs from OpenStreetMap data. The goal is to evaluate how much functionality of the [PostgreSQL implementation](https://github.com/philippks/ma-osm-aoi/tree/master/webapp) can be implemented with Apache Spark.

To get started, open this project with [Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).
